# Simplify Code Reviewer Prompts Reference

> Referenced by: `simplify-code` skill

## Reviewer 1 — Code Reuse

> Review this diff for code that duplicates functionality already in the codebase. Search utility modules, shared helpers, and adjacent files (use search_files / grep) for existing functions, constants, or patterns the new code could call instead of reimplementing. Flag: new functions that duplicate existing ones; hand-rolled logic that an existing utility already does (manual string/path manipulation, custom env checks, ad-hoc type guards, re-implemented parsing). For each, name the existing thing to use and where it lives.

## Reviewer 2 — Code Quality

> Review this diff for quality problems. Look for: redundant state (values that duplicate or could be derived from existing state; caches that don't need to exist); parameter sprawl (new params bolted on where the function should have been restructured); copy-paste-with-variation (near-duplicate blocks that should share an abstraction); leaky abstractions (exposing internals, breaking an existing encapsulation boundary); stringly-typed code (raw strings where a constant/enum/registry already exists — check the canonical registries before flagging); deeply nested conditionals (ternary chains, 3+-level if/else pyramids — flatten with guard clauses, early returns, or a lookup table); AI-generated slop patterns (extra comments restating obvious code like `// increment counter` above `count++`; unnecessary defensive null-checks on already-validated inputs; `as any` casts that bypass the type system; patterns inconsistent with the rest of the file). For each, give the concrete refactor.

## Reviewer 3 — Efficiency

> Review this diff for efficiency problems. Look for: unnecessary work (redundant computation, repeated file reads, duplicate API calls, N+1 access patterns); missed concurrency (independent ops run sequentially); hot-path bloat (heavy/blocking work on startup or per-request paths); TOCTOU anti-patterns (existence pre-checks before an op instead of doing the op and handling the error); memory issues (unbounded growth, missing cleanup, listener/handle leaks; long-lived callbacks or objects built as closures that capture the whole enclosing scope — everything captured stays alive as long as the object does, so prefer a small class or explicit-fields struct that copies only what it needs); overly broad reads (loading whole files when a slice would do); silent failures (empty catch blocks, ignored error returns, `except: pass`, `.catch(() => {})` with no handling, error propagation gaps — these hide bugs and should at minimum log before swallowing). For each, give the concrete fix and why it's faster or safer.

## Reviewer 4 — Altitude

> Review this diff for changes implemented at the wrong depth — band-aids layered on top of shared infrastructure instead of fixes to the infrastructure itself. Signs of a too-shallow fix: a special case added to a generic code path to handle one caller (an `if (caller == X)` branch, a type check, a magic-value escape hatch); a symptom patched at the call site while sibling call sites keep the same flaw; a workaround stacked on an earlier workaround; a wrapper added to avoid touching the thing that actually needs changing; configuration or flags introduced to route around a broken default instead of fixing the default. For each, identify the underlying mechanism the change is dodging and describe the deeper fix — generalize the shared path, fix the root default, or fix the whole bug class — and honestly note when the deeper fix is large enough that it should be its own task rather than part of this cleanup. Read the surrounding code and `git blame` first: what looks like a band-aid is sometimes a deliberate boundary (compat shims, staged migrations, vendored-code isolation). Don't flag those.

## Output Format (All Reviewers)

```
file:line → problem → cost (what's duplicated/wasted/harder to maintain) → suggested fix | confidence: high/medium/low | risk: SAFE/CAREFUL/RISKY
```

- **SAFE** = proven not to affect behavior (unused imports, commented-out code, pass-through wrappers). Auto-apply these.
- **CAREFUL** = improves without changing semantics (rename local variable, flatten nested ternary, extract helper). Apply with test verification.
- **RISKY** = may change behavior or breaks public contracts (N+1 restructuring, public API rename, memory lifecycle change). Flag for human review — do NOT auto-apply.
